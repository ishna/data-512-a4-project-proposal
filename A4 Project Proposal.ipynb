    "# Do healthy communities mean a better economy?\n",

    "### Abstract and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, there has been research to link health of citizens to the economic growth of a country. In a recent turn of events, a friend was involved in an accident in the United States (one of the stronger economies of the world) and had to struggle to get the medical care he deserved. Since that time, I read about more such experiences and a general displeasure towards healthcare facilities in the US. This made me wonder how access to healthcare, health of the citizens and growth in economy are related to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment in health is not only a desirable, but also an essential priority for most societies. Investments in health and the design of health financing policies should be addressed in terms of the interaction between health and the economy. Just as growth, income, investment and employment are a function of the performance and quality of the economic system, its regulatory frameworks, trade policies, social capital and labor markets, etc., so health conditions (mortality, morbidity, disability) depend not just on standards of living, but on the actual performance of health systems themselves. My aim with this project is to go over some of these interactions [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be considering the following human-centered data science perspectives:\n",
    "- Incorporate current affairs around the world focusing on healthcare and economic growth\n",
    "- Read research papers and work focusing on healthcare and economic growth\n",
    "- Focus on the research questions asked and how they do/don’t defy my assumptions about the system\n",
    "- Incorporating visualizations and quantitative analysis to support the results and inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I was inspired by the following research papers and articles:\n",
    "- Harvard Initiative for Health’s paper on role of health in economic development. The role of health in economic development is analyzed via two channels: the direct labor productivity e§ect and the indirect incentive effect. The labor productivity hypothesis asserts that individuals who are healthier have higher returns to labor input. This is well tested in the empirical literature with mixed conclusions\n",
    "- Blue Cross, Blue Shield’s article on healthy communities mean better economy: Healthier populations contribute to a stronger local economy, and a stronger local economy contributes to a healthier population. The strongest connection between health and the economy is sustaining a healthier workforce.\n",
    "- OECD article on Health and Economic Growth. Healthcare performance is strongly dependent on the economy, but also on the health systems themselves. This link should not be underestimated. \n",
    "- IZA Institute of Labour Economics article on Health and Economic Growth. The case for a positive effect of health on economic growth is strongest for less developed, post demographic transition countries and with respect to children’s health and women’s health. Health improvements for these populations spur increased investment in human capital, increased female labor force participation, and reduced fertility. Together, these forces can help trigger a demographic dividend and initiate a takeoff toward long-run economic growth.\n",
    "- The Obama White House article on economic case for healthcare. Health care expenditures in the United States are currently about 18 percent of GDP, and this share is projected to rise sharply. If health care costs continue to grow at historical rates, the share of GDP devoted to health care in the United States is projected to reach 34 percent by 2040.\n",
    "\n",
    "My main focus with this project is to understand the underlying relationship between health and economic indicators and benchmark these for a few countries (2 each from developed, developing and underdeveloped). My hypothesis is that a there is a strong and significant relationship between health of citizens of an economy and its growth. I believe that a poor healthcare system is a clear indicator of low economic growth of a country.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be analyzing quantitative and statistical evaluation metrics such as correlation, regression, p-values and confidence intervals, in addition to visualizing bar plots, time series plot., stack plots for comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using the World Bank Open Data [2] Free which is an open access to global development data. More specifically, I will be using the World Development Indicators data [3]. The World Development Indicators is a compilation of relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty. The database contains 1,600 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 country groups, with data for many indicators going back more than 50 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Bank collects and processes large amounts of data and generates them on the basis of economic models. These data and models have gradually been made available to the public in a way that encourages reuse, whereas the recent publications describing them are available as open access under a Creative Commons Attribution License. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going into further details, I want to compare the following metrics and base my analysis and research on the following mentioned spheres. To measure the economic development of a country, I will be using the following metrics:\n",
    "- GDP per capita growth rate [4] which is a World Bank national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files with a License Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (1229)\n",

    "While the studies I have cited as inspiration have drawn conclusions about healthcare affecting a host nation's economy, I do believe that such studies, more often than not, come under the usual \"correlation vs causation\" conundrum. My analysis might have a few similar loopholes, but I will try to cover as much as possible through rigorous research and analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the listed data points that I am considering are not exhaustive. There are many other factors that reflect healthcare and economic growth of a country. Given the paucity of time and domain knowledge, I picked out ones I felt will deliver the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ m not sure what sort of a new contribution this project will bring, apart from what’s already been done. However, it is a good exercise, verifying the claims made by the authors who have published the research on similar lines. Additionally, there are multiple studies on how spending on healthcare slows the economy. So, we might be looking at long term relationship of healthcare and economics which can be difficult to measure in the purview of this project.\n",
